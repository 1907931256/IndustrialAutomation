Welcome to SCADA ProcessViewer
==============================

SCADA ProcessViewer is a Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition system 
written in Free Pascal and Lazarus IDE.
The Free Pascal is platform independent, so you can write a SCADA project
once and then run it on various platforms without changing code.

Free Pascal at www.freepascal.org is a fast object pascal compiler (and more),
that runs on more than 20 platforms (linux, windows, BSD, OS/2, DOS, PowerPC,
and many more).

The Lazarus currently supports linux (gtk, gtk2 and qt4), all flavours of windows,
even wince, Mac OS X (gtk, qt4 and carbon), FreeBSD (gtk, gtk2).
There is experimental support for Solaris and the native pascal backend fpgui
which runs on windows, wince and linux.
