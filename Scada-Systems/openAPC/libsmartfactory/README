This library offers free implementations of different Industry 4.0 / Smart Factory
functionalities influding e.g. the Hermes standard (aka "The Hermes Standard" as
defined at https://the-hermes-standard.info) and the Smart Interface standard as
described in section "Smart Interface" at https://openapc.com/download/manual.pdf

There is a preprocessor switch defined, that decides which operating system is used:
- ENV_LINUX
- ENV_WINDOWS
- ENV_EMBEDDED
In case one implements variants for other platforms a similar switch has to be used
to encapsulate the platform-dependent part.

libsmartfactory is available in two flavours: libsmartfactory_wx ("Makefile" for
Linux, "libsmartfactory_wx.vcxproj" for Windows Visual Studio) makes use of the XML
functions of wxWidgets, libsmartfactory_pugixml ("MakefilePugiXML" for Linux,
"libsmartfactory_pugixml.vcxproj" for Windows Visual Studio) is free of any
wxWidgets-dependencies and requires PugiXML for all XML handling stuff.
