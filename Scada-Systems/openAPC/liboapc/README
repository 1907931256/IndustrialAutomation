These libraries offers different functions in a platform-independent way. They
encapsulate common functionalities in a more general, easier to use way (like the
network functions) or provide a standard interface to system-dependent functions
where no general solution exists in common toolkits like wxWidgets, Qt or others (like
the serial interface functions).

There are two libraries provided: liboapc contains functions that do not depend on
anyting else than the underlying operating system, liboapcwx depends on the wxWidgets
toolkit.

There is a preprocessor switch defined, that decides which operating system is used:
- ENV_LINUX
- ENV_WINDOWS
- ENV_QNX
In case one implements variants for other platforms a similar switch has to be used
to encapsulate the platform-dependent part.
