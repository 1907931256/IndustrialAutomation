Welcome to the SOES - Simple Open EtherCAT Slave Wiki

Please take a look at the Wiki to see all possible EtherCAT features that are  available within this project. Several slaves have been developped based on this framework.

A big "thank you" goes out to Ketels Machinefabriek who made the SOES stack available. This project is an implementation of their stack on STM32, plus an online tool to generate a consistent set of code, XML file and EEPROM. Minimum requisites to run this code are a Beckhoff ASIC (ET1200, ET1100) with an EEPROM, and a STM32 microcontroller. I'm using a STM32F5x.
