====== Using Qct with Subversion ======

Usage Notes:
  * Assumes you have a working svn command line tool
  * Assumes there is no passphrase required for rsh/ssh access

For a commit message template, place the template file in your
home directory: ~/.commit.template

PS:  The Subversion back-end is not as well tested as I would like.  If
you find a bug or find support for a particular svn feature not to your
liking, please send me an e-mail.
