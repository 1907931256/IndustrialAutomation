QCT - Qt/PyQt based commit tool

Author: Steve Borho <steve@borho.org>

Downloads:

http://qct.sourceforge.net/qct-version-win32.exe - Windows self-extracting zip
http://qct.sourceforge.net/qct-version.tar.gz    - Source code
http://qct.sourceforge.net/qct-version-py2.5.egg - Python Egg
http://qct.sourceforge.net/hg/qct                - Mercurial Repository

Primary goals:

1) Cross-Platform (Linux, Windows-Native, MacOS, cygwin)
2) Be VCS agnostic.
3) Good keyboard navigation, keep the typical work-flow simple

Keyboard Shortcuts:

CTRL-O  - Commit selected files
CTRL-R  - Refresh file list
CTRL-N  - View diffs of next file in list
CTRL-[] - Page up/down through file diffs
CTRL-U  - Unselect all files
CTRL-F  - Clear file filter text
ESC     - Abort and exit

The qct standalone application will attempt to auto-detect the
repository you are running from, but will also accept a command line
argument specifying the VCS back-end you wish to use.

See the man page for more usage details and consult the README file for
the version control system you wish to use.


Known Issues:

Windows has a command line limit of 32KBytes.  If you break this limit
you get to keep both halves :)
